Weapon Models plugin for SourceMod
===============

This is a sourcemod plugin which allows you to change both world and view model of any weapon server-side. The plugin provides both a config file and a simple but powerful API for adding custom weapon models.

### Disclaimer ######
This is by far not intended to work by Valve, and the implementation is pretty much a hack.

### List of compatible games ######
 * Counter-Strike: Source
 * Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Arm model need to be included
 * Day of Defeat: Source
 * Team-Fortress 2 - Arm model and animations need to be included

### Requirements ######
